## Quick setup
1. `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
2. Delete any coderage database in mySQL `node scripts/dbsetup.js` to set up your database

## User administration
Basic user administration (viewing and deleting users) is accessible at the `/admin` path. This path is only visible to users with the `admin` property (in the users database), which you can set with direct database access.

This outlines the base requirements for Project 2.

* Use a Node and Express Web Server;

* Be backed by a MySQL Database an ORM (not necessarily Sequelize);

* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data;

* Be deployed using Heroku (with Data);

* Utilize at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed;

* Have a polished frontend / UI;

* Have folder structure that meets MVC Paradigm;

* Meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming).

* Must not expose sensitive API key information on the server, see [Protecting-API-Keys-In-Node.md](../../../10-nodejs/03-Supplemental/Protecting-API-Keys-In-Node.md)
